1. Heat butter and oil in a large pot.  
Cook leek, capsicum, cauliflower and salt for about  
4 minutes, until they have softened.

1. Pat the chicken dry and add it to a large bowl with flour, pepper, lemon zest and garlic.  
Toss to coat chicken and set aside.

1. Add bulgur wheat to the veggies.  
Stir and cook for 1 minute, until the bulgur wheat is coated in oil and butter.
Add boiling water and stock to pot, bring it to a boil and then cover it with a tight lid.
Reduce to the lowest heat and cook for around 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and leave to steam, still covered, for a further 18 minutes.
Do not lift the lid during that time.

1. Heat some oil in a large fry pan and cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side until it's golden and cooked through. Set aside covered, and let it rest for 2-3 minutes.

1. Chop the spinach into big chunks and set it aside.
Mix lemon yoghurt ingredients together in a small bowl.

1. Once the bulgur wheat is cooked, fluff up the grains with a fork and gently fold through spinach, lemon zest and juice.
Season with pepper and salt.

1. Serve the chicken over bulgur wheat salad and top it with the lemon yoghurt.
